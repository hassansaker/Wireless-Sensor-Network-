# **Wireless Sensor Network for Air Pollution Monitoring**

## **Project Overview**
This project involves designing and simulating a **Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)** for air pollution monitoring in a smart city environment using **CupCarbon**. The simulation focuses on optimizing **node placement, network connectivity, energy efficiency, and data transmission performance**.

## **Features**
- **City Map Integration:** Import a city map and identify key pollution-prone areas.
- **WSN Design:** Deploy sensor nodes in industrial zones, highways, residential areas, and parks.
- **Multi-hop Communication:** Sensors relay data to a sink node using ZigBee communication.
- **Performance Optimization:** Improve network efficiency by adjusting node positions and transmission intervals.
- **Analysis & Visualization:** Evaluate network metrics such as **packet delivery ratio, energy consumption, and average delay**.

## **Technologies Used**
- **CupCarbon** (WSN Simulation Tool)
- **ZigBee Protocol** (Wireless Communication)
- **Java (if required for CupCarbon)**
